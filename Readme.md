# About

Echo offers a collection of [powerful Cloud Services](http://aboutecho.com/WhatWeOffer/EchoPlatform) that do the heavy lifting for real-time, social applications. This SDK is designed to make it easy for JavaScript app developers to consume these cloud services while producing more interoperable and consistent apps by addressing the following general app development challenges:

+ JS API - Easier access to server-side APIs via the client side
+ GUI Library - More consistent look and feel between apps (Bootstrap)
+ UI Controls - A Core set of UI Controls for common app/interaction patterns
+ Component Manifest - Consistent app architecture for plugin extensibility, consistent configuration handling and + app interoperability
+ Echo Loader - Simplified dependency loading to reduce script conflicts and redundancies
+ Configuration storage and overrides (coming soon)
+ Centralized deployment management and administration (coming soon)
